# How does it works?

First of all you need to declare it in your layout xml file

```xml
<com.example.lib.Deck
        android:id="@+id/deck_pager"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
```

then you just need to set deck default padding

```kotlin
private val deckPager by lazy { activity.findViewById<Deck>(R.id.deck_pager) }

private fun initDeck() {
    deckPager.setDefaultPadding(activity)
}
```

or set padding based on percentage of the screen width

```kotlin
deckPager.setPercentagePadding(activity, 8)
```

or set padding based on dp value

```kotlin
deckPager.setDpPadding(activity, 16)
```

##### Remember you can set all other view pager properties with deck

# Deck properties

These are all properties supported in deck's xml

```xml
<com.example.lib.Deck
        android:id="@+id/deck_pager"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        app:padding_percentage="8"
        app:padding_dp="16dp"/>
```
